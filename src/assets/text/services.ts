    info: "Chip tuning involves modifying the electronic control unit (ECU) of your vehicle to enhance its performance. The ECU controls key engine functions, such as fuel injection, ignition timing, and boost pressure. By adjusting these parameters, we can increase your engine's power output, improve throttle response, and optimize fuel consumption. ECU mapping is the process of reprogramming your car's ECU with a custom map designed for your specific vehicle. This map is a set of instructions that tells the engine how to behave under various conditions. At SGPerformance, we use state-of-the-art tools and software to create custom ECU maps that maximize your vehicle's performance without compromising reliability.At SGPerformance, we combine cutting-edge technology with years of experience to deliver tuning solutions that transform your driving experience. Our team of experts is passionate about performance, and we’re committed to helping you achieve the perfect balance between power, efficiency, and reliability.",

    info: "A turbocharger is a forced induction device that increases an engine's power output by forcing extra air into the combustion chamber. This allows the engine to burn more fuel, resulting in more power and improved performance. Turbochargers are a popular upgrade for those seeking significant gains in horsepower and torque without increasing engine displacement.For vehicles that come without a factory-installed turbocharger, our turbo conversion services provide a comprehensive solution to boost your engine's performance. We carefully select and install the right turbocharger kit for your vehicle, ensuring a perfect balance between power, reliability, and drivability.If your vehicle is already equipped with a turbocharger, our upgrade services can help you extract even more power from your engine. At SGPerformance, we only use top-quality turbochargers and components from trusted brands to ensure the best possible results: Garrett: A leader in turbocharging technology, Garrett offers a wide range of high-performance turbos known for their reliability and efficiency.",
